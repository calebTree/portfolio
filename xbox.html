Now, nearly 20 years later, as a CIT undergraduage, I had a new appreciation for the history of electronics and vintage computing equipment.</p><p>As I shopped online in 2019 I was surprised by the availability yet also by how many of them were for sale with mods.

I did learn 1.0s are the most common, yet I still decided against modding this one right away.</p><h3>xbox modding history</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/bunnie/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html">https://www.bunniestudios.com/bunnie/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011221074208/http://web.mit.edu:80/bunnie/www/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20011221074208/http://web.mit.edu:80/bunnie/www/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html</a></li><li><a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/19/how-the-xbox-was-hacked/">https://hackaday.com/2018/11/19/how-the-xbox-was-hacked/</a></li><li><a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/xbox.htm">https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/xbox.htm</a></li><li><a href="http://adriancallaghan.co.uk/wp-content/downloads/Guides/XBOX_REPAIR_GUIDE.pdf">http://adriancallaghan.co.uk/wp-content/downloads/Guides/XBOX_REPAIR_GUIDE.pdf</a></li></ul><p>Original XBOX modding is challanging yet rewarding and I have learned allot from my research.</p></article><article><h2>First</h2><p id="revs">The original XBOX went through several revisions that range from 1.0 - 1.6b. How to identify the mainboard revision is a good place to start. There are a few aesthetic clues that can help identify the revision before even cracking it open. For example, the year made on the barcode sticker, and the shape of the DVD tray.</p><p>Next, check the clock capacitor. The clock capacitors on the original XBOX are known to deteriorate and leak acid which can cause damage to the PCB and surrounding components. Microsoft apparently broke the norm by using a capacitor instead of a lithium coin cell battery to hold clock time. On most mainboard revisisons it is advisable to remove the capacitor completely then clean up any leaked acid. Doing so does not affect functionality.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://xboxdevwiki.net/Hardware_Revisions">https://xboxdevwiki.net/Hardware_Revisions</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="assets/clock-capacitor-location-e33b62.jpg">clock-cap (location)</a> &bull; <a target="_blank" href="assets/clock-capacitor-ea656b.jpg">clock-cap</a> &bull; <a target="_blank" href="assets/capacitor-removed-361768.jpg">clock-cap (removed)</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/wiki/clock_capacitor">https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/wiki/clock_capacitor</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gadgetsarena.org/original-xbox-clock-capacitor-removal-remove-it-b/">https://www.gadgetsarena.org/original-xbox-clock-capacitor-removal-remove-it-b/</a></li></ul></article><article><h2>Softmod</h2><p>The goal of a softmod is to gain privilages <em>through software</em> to kernel mode memory which then would make it possible to run software that was not originally intended by the manufacturer. Once that is accomplished, persistance is obtained by installing a modified shell. Basically the shell in XBOX terms is called a dashboard. There are quite a few guides out there on how to softmod (some of which require more complex steps than others). A bit of obscure equipment is necessary including a 512 MB USB thumb drive, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCFGG8Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">a USB XBOX controller adapter</a>.

A few additional pieces of special equipment are required. The softmod method requires a little practice and luck because it involves hot-swapping the optical drive for the new HDD before the XBOX notices.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBC9599ww6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBC9599ww6I</a></li></ul><p>A softmod is all that is necessary to add tons of useability to an original XBOX. I categorize most of the modding I have talked about so far as a softmod because no soldering has been necessary yet.</p></article><article><h3>Hardmod</h3><p>This is where some skill is involved and things get interesting.</p><p>The first step to upgrading RAM is loading a firmware/BIOS/kernel that is compatible with variable RAM quantity (the stock BIOS is not). In XBOX terms firmware, BIOS, kernel, TSOP, EEPROM are all the same thing because the kernel is included on the same chip as the BIOS. Loading a 3rd party BIOS can be achieved in a few ways. The first would be to reconnect the write protection circut of the TSOP and flash a new firmware directly onto the built-in ROM. The second method is to install a modchip which typically stores multiple BIOS images that can be loaded as needed.</p><p>Disabling write protection on the TSOP is different given the mainboard revision. On the 1.0 in this case there are two solder points to join. R7D3 on the top and R7R4 on the bottom. When that is done it is as simple as writing XBlast_OS_v0.56 onto the TSOP. The XBlast_OS BIOS allows the XBOX to boot with variable RAM quantities and a test feature for each RAM chip as you go.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.biline.ca/xbox_solder.htm">http://www.biline.ca/xbox_solder.htm</a></li><li><a href="https://digiex.net/threads/microsoft-xbox-dashboard-kernel-4034-4817-4920-and-5659-download.14886/">https://digiex.net/threads/microsoft-xbox-dashboard-kernel-4034-4817-4920-and-5659-download.14886/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Ryzee119/OpenXenium">https://github.com/Ryzee119/OpenXenium</a></li><li><a href="http://www.openxenium.com">http://www.openxenium.com</a></li></ul><p>I had success on my first RAM upgrade attempt with XBlast BIOS on the built in TSOP. However, I accidentily reflashed the ROM with an incorrect original BIOS which caused it to fail to boot. At that point I attempted to install the OpenXeinum modchip. However, I was not skilled enough and lacked the correct equipment and thus ended up frying the board.</p></article></main><footer><div><img src="assets/2bc-c1ab94.png" alt="to be continued" width="243" height="62"></div><a href="/"><button class="back-btn">Back</button></a> <button class="to-top" title="Go to top">Top</button></footer></body></html>
