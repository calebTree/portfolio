It is the only game console I have ever owned after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis" target="_blank">Sega Genesis</a>. Now, nearly 20 years later, as a CIT undergraduage, I had a new appreciation for these electronics milestones and achievments as I became motivated to further my understanding of digital mediums. College provides students with oportunities to open their minds to new ideas and thus suddenly a mondane XBOX to me, could be much more than a child's toy with buttons and TV graphics. Near the end of my junior year I decided to look online for a replacement for the XBOX I got rid of when I finished high school. Could I even find one?</p><p>As I shopped online in 2019 I was very surprised by their availability yet I was even more surprised to see how many of them were for sale purporting to have "mods" pre-intalled. Little did I know of the vast expanse of efforts to circumvent the XBOX security measure which protected the operating system lay before me left by the nearly 20 year old game console.</p></article><article><p>Before jumping head first into modding electronics I highly recommend familiarizing one's self with the basics of troubleshooting and soldering electronics.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZv3eVnjjDKo0G9AIOA48qtfylxDc9d9">Basics of soldering</a>.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/xty1G5UBYb0">Skilled soldering techniques</a>.</li></ul></article><article><p>The first XBOX unit I bought online I was lucky enough arrived unopened (stickers in tact). After I learned a little more about these I also saw that this one was maybe a 1.0 mainboard revision which I intuitively thought must be unique or collectable (more on <a href="#revs">mainboard revisons</a> later). However, even though the internet told me 1.0s are the most common, I still decided against modding this one right away, so I put it aside, and bought another one that was already opened. That was November 2019, I worked on that a while, had some fun, then I gave it away. In October 2020 I still had my 1.0 and I bit the bullet, broke the stickers, and opened it up.</p><h5>More original xbox modding history and milestones:</h5><ul><li><a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/bunnie/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html">https://www.bunniestudios.com/bunnie/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011221074208/http://web.mit.edu:80/bunnie/www/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20011221074208/http://web.mit.edu:80/bunnie/www/proj/anatak/xboxmod.html</a></li><li><a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/19/how-the-xbox-was-hacked/">https://hackaday.com/2018/11/19/how-the-xbox-was-hacked/</a></li><li><a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/xbox.htm">https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/xbox.htm</a></li><li><a href="http://adriancallaghan.co.uk/wp-content/downloads/Guides/XBOX_REPAIR_GUIDE.pdf">http://adriancallaghan.co.uk/wp-content/downloads/Guides/XBOX_REPAIR_GUIDE.pdf</a></li></ul><p>A few of the fun challenges, in my opinion, about working with the original XBOX is that not only are the guides and information out there skattered all around the internet on forums and blogs in the first place but when information is found, it generally has not undergon any form of QA that might be expected from mainstream software or guides. Generally, the tools and guides availalbe are built by hobbiests and enthusiasts in their free time.</p></article><article><h3>First</h3><p id="revs">There are a few beginner things to be aware of when one first starts to mod an original XBOX. How to identify the mainboard revision is a good place to start. Because the secret ROM was cracked so quickly OG XBOX mainboards went through several revisions that range from 1.0 - 1.6b. To start, interestingly, there are a few external clues that can be used to help identify the mainboard version without the need to open it up. For example, by looking at the year made on the barcode sticker, and the shape of the DVD tray. The next thing to look at is to check the clock capacitor, the clock capacitors on these are known to deteriorate. Also XBOX broke the norm by using a capacitor instead of a lithium coin cell battery to hold clock time. On most mainboard revisisons it is advisable to remove the capacitor completely and this does not affect functionality.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://xboxdevwiki.net/Hardware_Revisions">https://xboxdevwiki.net/Hardware_Revisions</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="assets/clock-capacitor-location-e33b62.jpg">clock-cap (location)</a> &bull; <a target="_blank" href="assets/clock-capacitor-ea656b.jpg">clock-cap</a> &bull; <a target="_blank" href="assets/capacitor-removed-361768.jpg">clock-cap (removed)</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/wiki/clock_capacitor">https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/wiki/clock_capacitor</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gadgetsarena.org/original-xbox-clock-capacitor-removal-remove-it-b/">https://www.gadgetsarena.org/original-xbox-clock-capacitor-removal-remove-it-b/</a></li></ul></article><article><h3>The Softmod</h3><p>Eventually I stumbled on a simple guide illustrating how to perform the <em>softmod</em>. The goal of a softmod is essentially to gain privilages through software to kernel mode operating system code that will make it possible to run software that was not originally intended by the manufacturer. The ultimate goal of an XBOX softmod is to install a persistant modified operating system. The shell to the operating system in XBOX terms is called the dashboard. There are quite a few guides out there on how to softmod (some of which require more complex steps than others). A bit of obscure equipment necessary was a 512 MB USB thumb drive which I luckily already had, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCFGG8Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">a USB XBOX controller adapter</a>. Apparently an OG XBOX controller is essentially a modified USB device. Although there are other possible ways to softmod an XBOX; I have found this "<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Rocky5/Xbox-Softmodding-Tool">XBOX Softmodding Tool</a>" to be the most mainstreamed. I do have one warning before softmodding. The afformentioned tool comes with a function to reverse the softmod - nearly bringing your XBOX back to a factory state. However, it does leave behind a file that I have yet to find a way to delete from the restored manufacturer's dashboard. If you have concluded that it is worth it to sftmod there are a couple of steps to bring the hacked savegame files over to the XBOX via your new equipment I mentoned above but once that is complete you'll find your XBOX softmodded before you know it.</p><p>The first thing to do with the softmodded XBOX is familiarize yourself with the partition and file system structure. There is at least a C, an E and X, Y, Z partition. More on F and G partitions later. C and E are user partitions but X, Y, Z are used by the system for cache. There are also UDATA and TDATA folders. Those folders store settings and save files for games. It took me a while to get used to how the partitions are setup. In each partition there can be folders named "Applications, Games, Emulation, Dashboard" etc. It doesn't matter to the shell (I like UnleashX) which partition the folder is on; all of the similarly named folders will appear to the shell as one. The filesystem and system files look a little chaotic at first. Most dashboards have a "File Explorer" type app to brows folders and files. It provides all the necessary functions one would expect from a file system through the human interface of the controller. To accomodate a controller interface the File Explorer is split down the middle. Both sides are the same file system. To move or copy a file or directory navigate to the file of interest on one side (either side) then to the destination on the opposite side, press start and make your selection. The opposite side from the selection is interpreted as the destination.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnL1ttepaDo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnL1ttepaDo</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/how-to-softmod-the-original-xbox.385064/">https://gbatemp.net/threads/how-to-softmod-the-original-xbox.385064/</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.smdepot.net/forum/index.php?topic=544.0">http://www.smdepot.net/forum/index.php?topic=544.0</a></li><li><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201</a></li></ul><p>This was fun, I had a modded XBOX! Now what? The Rocky5 "Softmodding Tool" includes allot of useful functionaly. One of my favorites is a dashboard called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Rocky5/XBMC-Emustation">XBMC-Emustation</a> which is where I might expect one to spend most of their time on a modded XBOX. It includes allot of popular emulators built in. The emulators I had the most luck with were SEGA Genesis, NES, SNES, and PSX. One of the most important emulators to me was the Genesis emulator. The best place I found Gensis ROMs was <a target="_blank" href="https://the-eye.eu/public/rom/Sega%20Genesis/">the-eye</a>. I was impressed that I could run some PSX games as well. In this case XBMC-Emustation uses a port of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emuxtras.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=4843">PCSX</a> for the PSX emulator. When using this emulator however keep in mind that various games require specific settings that need to be correctly set the first time the game is started. No worries though because it is trivial to delete the config files and try again if it's wrong but just something to keep in mind if the game is not working correctly.</p><p>Next, I realized that the next mod I was going to need was a HDD upgrade. This took some gathering of additional specialized equipment as well as some practice and luck but again it was a rewarding project.</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBC9599ww6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBC9599ww6I</a></li></ul><p>A softmod is all that is necessary to add tons of useability to an original XBOX. I categorize most of the modding I have talked about so far as a softmod because no soldering has been necessary yet.</p></article><article><h3>The Hardmod</h3><p>This is where some skill is involved and things get interesting. I couldn't find a good reason to hardmod until I found the original Half-Life homebrew on XBMC-Emustation and learned that it comes in two versions. A 64MB version (stock XBOX) where complex textures have been deleted to accomodate limited memory. As well as the 128 MB version which works on units that have been hardmodded with double the RAM.</p><p>The first thing that has to be done to upgrade the RAM on an XBOX is load a firmware/BIOS/kernel (in XBOX modding community lingo these are all the same thing) that is compatible with various RAM capacity (the stock BIOS is not). That can be done one of two ways. The first slightly more risky method would be to short the write protection out to the built in ROM called the TSOP and flash a new firmware onto that. The second lesss risky method is to install a modchip which stores multiple BIOS images that can be loaded on demand and this way the built in BIOS does not have to be tampered with.</p><p>To disable write protectionn on the 1.0 mainboard revision there are two solder points to join. R7D3 on the top and R7R4 on the bottom. When that is done it is as simple as writing XBlast_OS_v0.56 onto the TSOP. The XBlast_OS BIOS allows the XBOX to boot with varying RAM quantities which would normally cause it to fail to boot. When the BIOS is flashed simply soldered the RAM onto each open position testing each one using XBlast_OS as you go.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.biline.ca/xbox_solder.htm">http://www.biline.ca/xbox_solder.htm</a></li><li><a href="https://digiex.net/threads/microsoft-xbox-dashboard-kernel-4034-4817-4920-and-5659-download.14886/">https://digiex.net/threads/microsoft-xbox-dashboard-kernel-4034-4817-4920-and-5659-download.14886/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Ryzee119/OpenXenium">https://github.com/Ryzee119/OpenXenium</a></li><li><a href="http://www.openxenium.com">http://www.openxenium.com</a></li></ul><p>I was lucky my first try loding right to the built in TSOP and soldering 4 new RAM chips on but the fun didn't last. The project did become allot more interesting though. Instead of everything just working hunky dorry I finally had some troubleshooting work on my hands. At this point it was time for me to read up on electric circuts theory and hardware reverse engineering which is hard for me to beleive was lacking up until now in my many years of formal education.</p></article></main><footer><div class="tbc"><img src="assets/2bc-e69ca7.png" alt="to be continued" width="695" height="176"></div><a href="/"><button class="back-btn">Back</button></a> <button class="to-top" title="Go to top">Top</button></footer></body></html>
