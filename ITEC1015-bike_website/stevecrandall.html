<p>Steve Crandall is the founder of the FBM bike company so he works on BMX bike parts. He is also and an amazing graffiti artist. I shook his hand at the skatepark JSAW in Chanhassen. I was just riding there one day and he randomly showed up with a bunch of his friendsa nd rode and hung out and stuff. It was the coolest thing ever, I shook his hand right when I saw him and I was thrilled to see him. I knew of him from my BMX videos and everything and FBM is one of my favorite bike companies.</p>
